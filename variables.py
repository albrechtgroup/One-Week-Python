# Variables in Python:
age = 42
# age + 1 = 43

# Naming variables:
# Underscore is Popular in Python*
player_one = 0
# all capital letter var names indicate a 'const'
PI = 3.14259

score = 500
score = score + 500

# Assignment Operators:
score += 500
score -= 1000

# The 'print' function: The print() func prints out any
# values we pass to "standard output". It does not
# return anything.

# MAGIC Exercise:
# Create a variable called secret_num and set it to any
# number you'd like.
secret_num = 7
# Increase secret_num by 1.
secret_num += 1
# Next, take the new number and double it.
secret_num *= 2
# Next, take the new number and add four to it.
secret_num += 4
# Next, take the new number and divide by 2.
secret_num /= 2
# Next, take the new number and subtract your original 
# number from it.
secret_num -= 7
# Print the final result.
print(secret_num)
